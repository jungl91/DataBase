# Ultrasound DataBase
Database of Benign and Malignant Solid lesions on breast ultrasound images.

The dataset included 105 ultrasound images of cytologically and/or histologically proven 50 benign and 55 malignant non-cystic lesions. 

Data obtained with the help of the following ultrasound systems: Medison SA8000SE, Siemens X150, Esaote MyLab C and 7.5-12 MHz probes. 

On the each image, the radiologist traced the contours of the inner hypoechoic area of the lesion and its outer area.
This traced images stored in the nested "MASK" folder.
